today we learned how to make SSH keys and keep it on github.
However I had some trouble when I tried to use the command "git push" on my terminal because the password authentification doesn't work anymore, so after the class I checked out the manual on github and made another ssh key, and I figured out that I have to clone the SSH adress to make a local repistory, not https one. Also I learned how to git push via vscode, which is easier than using terminal.

Today, I successfully managed to attach a git tag to the main branch, rectifying last week's oversight where I mistakenly tagged another branch. To bolster my git proficiency, I practiced on `learngitbranching.js.org`, which proved immensely beneficial.

We also delved deeper into sorting and selecting files using command lines. Initially, some of the commands were daunting due to my unfamiliarity with them. However, after engaging in exercises and hands-on practices, I'm gaining confidence and feel I'm progressing in the right direction.

We deepened our understanding of Bash scripting by exploring its loop structures, particularly the 'for' and 'while' loops. In Bash, 'for' loops are commonly employed to iterate over a series of items, whereas 'while' loops repeat actions based on the fulfillment of a specific condition.

To elevate the scripts we crafted last week, we can integrate a 'while' loop. This would enable us to continually search for files until we find one that satisfies our criteria - in this case, a specific number in the filename.

In last week's assignment, I made an attempt with the 'while' loop but found it challenging. However, after today's hands-on session, I feel much more confident in my grasp of its mechanics and application.

Today, my primary objective was to extract data from a series of web links. Utilizing tools like `curl` and `wget`, I was able to seamlessly retrieve content from URLs listed in a text file. The script was designed to iterate over each URL, capture its content, and store it.

However, I realized that the real challenge lies in processing and presenting the data in a structured manner. Parsing through HTML using Bash commands felt a bit intimidating.

I've also learned the importance of commenting, structuring, and testing when writing bash scripts. The journey of mastering Bash scripting, while challenging, has been incredibly rewarding so far.
