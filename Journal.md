today we learned how to make SSH keys and keep it on github.
However I had some trouble when I tried to use the command "git push" on my terminal because the password authentification doesn't work anymore, so after the class I checked out the manual on github and made another ssh key, and I figured out that I have to clone the SSH adress to make a local repistory, not https one. Also I learned how to git push via vscode, which is easier than using terminal.

I finally figured out how to attach git tag a to main brach. I mistakenly attach to other branch  in last week's class, and I also tried to learn some git skills by practicing on learngitbranching.js.org , and it helps a lot !! 
Today we learn further how to sort and pick files by using command lines, which include some commands that I'm quite intimidate to use because I haven't ever meeted them before, but after some excercises and practices, I think maybe I'm on the right track and getting better.

We learned how to write a Bash script that contains a for loop or a while loop. For loops in Bash scripts are typically used for iterating over a set of items and while loops are used for repeating an action until a specific condition is met. 
So if we want to improve and upgrade the bash scripts we made last week, we can try to use a while loop to iterate the action of searching the file that meets our needs, which is a condition, the number in the filename.
I tried a while loop in last week's assignment but I didn't understand it very well, but after today's practice, I feel like I'm got to know how it works.
