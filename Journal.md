today we learned how to make SSH keys and keep it on github.
However I had some trouble when I tried to use the command "git push" on my terminal because the password authentification doesn't work anymore, so after the class I checked out the manual on github and made another ssh key, and I figured out that I have to clone the SSH adress to make a local repistory, not https one. Also I learned how to git push via vscode, which is easier than using terminal.
